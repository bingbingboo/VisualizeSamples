# Visualize Samples

See the wiki for details.

* [https://github.com/sgwood63/VisualizeSamples/wiki/Cascading-Input-Controls-and-Visualize.js "Overview of Cascading Input Controls and Visualize.js"]

When the JasperReports Server displays cascading input controls, it shows drop down lists for single selects, and a multi-select widget for multiple selects. As cascading values are selected in the UI, the related input controls are refreshed and displayed for selection.

How it all works with Visualize.

* VisualizeCascadingTree - A hierarchical, tree based (cascading) input control

VisualizeCascadingTree presents a hierarchical tree of values, based on the popular Javascript Fancytree control [https://github.com/mar10/fancytree]  and visualize.js. Fancytree samples are here: [http://wwwendt.de/tech/fancytree/demo/index.html]

It is a reusable component to use in your own web application. There are many extension points you can use to customize the look and feel and interactivity to meet your requirements.

* VisualizeFolderTree [https://github.com/sgwood63/VisualizeSamples/wiki/VisualizeFolderTree]

VisualizeFolderTree presents the JasperReports Server as a hierarchical tree in your web user interface, also based on Fancytree and also reusable.
